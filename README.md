# Recursive Delete
This simple python script allows you to delete multiple folders if it has the same name but differentiated by a number, this allows for quick and easy mass deletion!

This script will allow you to hopefully delete all the pesky folders ***in the same directory the script is in***.

## Please Note
#### I used this script on my Linux Based Machine, I have not tested if it works on Windows/MacOS however this did the job for me when I needed to delete over 1000 folders which all had the same name but differentiated by numbers.

## How do I use it?
#### Download the python script and run in terminal:
```python
python3 recursivedelete.py
```
Answer the 3 simple questions and watch as all those folders disappear!
